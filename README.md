===========

This is an android app for people to colaborate and work on fixing the
problems in their communities. The functionalities of this app are
people can post a job (something they want to fix in their locality) 
and others can volunteer if they want to or track the status of the 
work. 


This app was made as part of war of the worlds hackathon. I was a part of 
5 member team and I wrote the android app for this project. We were given 
an honourable mention.
